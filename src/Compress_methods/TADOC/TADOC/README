The university IP policy requires that the sharing is for the reviewing process only and the reviewers are expected to keep the code confidential and to use it only for the review purpose; we may open-source the code after finishing the paperwork with the university on IP concerns. 


1. Please run ``bash compile.sh'' to compile TADOC first.
